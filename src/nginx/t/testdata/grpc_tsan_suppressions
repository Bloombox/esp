# TSAN is unable to capture how NGINX uses eventfd and epoll to synchronize
# writing and then reading the ngx_notify handler in
# third_party/nginx/src/event/modules/ngx_epoll_module.c.
# There will be a true data race, if another NGINX module uses ngx_notify, but
# that's not what TSAN is complaining about.
